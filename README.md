Welcome to GadgetGroove, a modern, responsive, and feature-rich front-end for an e-commerce website selling phones, laptops, and accessories. This project was built from the ground up to showcase a complete user interface based on Material 3's expressive design principles.

The website is designed to be fun, bouncy, and highly interactive, providing a professional and engaging user experience across all devices.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories, preparing it for full-stack development.

```

|--- ðŸ“‚ frontend/
|    |--- ðŸ“„ index.html
|    |--- (all other .html files)
|    |--- ðŸŽ¨ style.css

## How to Use

To view and interact with the website:

1.  **Clone or download** the project files.
2.  Navigate to the `frontend/` directory.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
4.  Explore the different pages and features\!

## Next Steps

This project serves as a complete front-end blueprint. The next logical step is to build the **backend** to power the application. This would involve:

1.  Setting up a Node.js/Express server in the `backend/` directory.
2.  Connecting to a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) to store products and user data.
3.  Building a REST API to allow the front-end to communicate with the server.
4.  Integrating a payment gateway like Paystack or Stripe.
